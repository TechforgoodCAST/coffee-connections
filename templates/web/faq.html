                What data do I have to share?
            </h3>
            <p>
                We ask for data that will make Coffee Connections matches possible and to help us monitor impact:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your name</li>
                <li>Your email address</li>
                <li>Your organisation name</li>
                <li>Your job title</li>
                <li>A brief description about yourself (this is so that your match has some context about you before you meet)</li>
                <li>Where you’re based</li>
                <li>Where you rate your charity with digital</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We will only share your data with the people you are matched with, as part of an automated, random matching process.
            </p>
            <p>
                We’ll keep your data as long as the Coffee Connections initiative is running, or until you choose to opt out. To opt out, get in touch with Tori Ellaway on tori@wearecast.org.uk and we’ll delete your data.
            </p>
            <h3>
                How does the matching process work?
            </h3>
            <p>
                We send out matches every 2 months. The matching process is automated and completely random, but we try to avoid matching you with anyone from your organisation or who you've previously matched with.
            </p>
            <p>
                We’ll send you and your match an email introduction, then it’s over to you to arrange. During the pandemic, all meetings should take place online. We recommend a video call, but telephone works too if your internet connection isn’t great.
            </p>
            <p>
                To make Coffee Connections a good experience for everyone involved, we ask that participants make every effort to chat with their matches at some point.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you’ve been matched with the same person more than once, or you haven’t received a match in over 2 months, please let Tori Ellaway know on tori@wearecast.org.uk. 
            </p>
            <h3>
                What should we talk about?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Anything and everything! Here are some suggestions for questions to ask?
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>What are you working on at the moment?</li>
                <li>What’s one problem you’d like help with?</li>
                <li>What do you find helps you in your role?</li>
                <li>What are you struggling with in your role?</li>
                <li>Do you have any contacts who might be good for the other person to talk to? Can you introduce them?</li>
                <li>Any events/training/reading you can recommend?</li>
            </ul>
